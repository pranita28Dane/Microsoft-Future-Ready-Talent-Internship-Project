### Project Title :
Health Center E-Hospital

### Problem Statement/Opportunity :
Today, because of the pandemic, the number of patients in hospitals has increased a lot and you have to wait a long time for a test. Selecting the right drug for the type of disease becomes difficult and often takes time and makes the patient or customer wait. Therefore, the waiting time of customers is wasted.

### Project Description :
This is the medical system that manages hospital activities. New patients can use the website to make an appointment. The site confirms appointments based on the availability of individual physicians and notifies patients. It is very important to maintain efficient software to process information in the hospital. This application provides a way to record this information and access it in an easy way. Effective control of key processes is critical to a hospital's success. Due to the pandemic, it has easily reduced accounting tasks, resulting in less manpower and more accurate speed. Doctor and patient appointments have become easier and we can read patient reviews. The site offers many services such as free inspections, 24-hour ambulance, bed facilities, and more.
